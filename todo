This is old:

- Query pyraf/numarray forum about interpolation artifact and speed of
  affine_transform

- Make all the DataSet stuff work transparently for simple FITS files
  as well as SCI extensions of MEF files

- Remove the assumption that the first 2 axes are spatial
  - Instead figure out which WCS axes are RA and Dec in __init__,
    based on the CTYPE keywords
  - If there are no CTYPE keywords or they are LINEAR, assume
    that RA is the first axis and Dec is the second?
  - Go through all the DataSet methods and make sure this information
    is used, instead of the previous assumption
  - Check whether I have assumed anywhere that the first *array* axes
    are spatial, or just the first WCS axes

- Read and write data quality arrays, to allow bad pixel rejection and
  blanking outside the area of the input data

- Implement weighting and rejection

- Implement a copy() method and basic operators for DataSets?
